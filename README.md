# What Jirozaur does?
Jirozaur helps you paste saved text into web page text fields.
Enter text and ID of the text field you wanna insert text into and click 'PasteIt' to paste it. Click 'SaveIt' to save text and IDs for later. Buttons 'SaveItAll' and 'PasteItAll' helps you do four actions at once :)

# How to get text field ID? What is it?
The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document). According to W3Schools. **Too much blahblahblah?** Just right click on the text field which you are interested in and and use Jirozaur context action to get and save its text field's ID. Easy, isn't it?

# Add-on inspiration notes
